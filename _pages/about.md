I am a postdoc associate of [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae) at Cornell University. I work in the [Laboratory of Intelligent Systems and Control (LISC)](http://lisc.mae.cornell.edu/wordpress/) directed by [Dr. Silvia Ferrari](http://lisc.mae.cornell.edu/wordpress/?page_id=33). I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech under supervision of [Dr. Andrew Kurdila](https://me.vt.edu/people/faculty/kurdila-andrew.html). Before joining Cornell, I worked with [Dr. Fumin Zhang](https://fumin.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech as a postdoc research fellow. 

Research Insterests
------
My research interests concentrate in enhancing robot autonomy by combining principles from control theory, dynamical systems theory, and machine learning. Under this topic, I am particularly interested in information-theoretic strategies that enable mobile robots to autonomously acquire pertinent information from unstructured environment. I also study how to assimilate sensory data with first principles, statistical learning, and human input to formulate succinct while informative model of environment.
